Python Practice – TechPrep at Murphy Center

This file contains Python programs created for the TechPrep course at Murphy Center. These exercises help build essential programming skills such as input/output, randomness, loops, functions, and working with CSV files using the pandas library.

Included Programs:

1. Magic 8 Ball:
Simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball toy. The user asks a yes/no question, and the program gives a random answer. Responses include at least 3 affirmatives, 3 non-committals, and 3 negatives.

Example:
Will I pass the test?
Magic 8 Ball says: "Don't count on it."

2. Fortune Cookie:
Displays a random fortune along with four lucky numbers between 1 and 99. Includes at least 6 possible fortune messages.

Example:
Your fortune: "Big surprises are coming your way."
Lucky numbers: 7, 24, 39, 85

3. FizzBuzz:
Prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, prints "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, prints "Buzz"; and for multiples of both, prints "FizzBuzz".

Example output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
...

4. Student Grade Analyzer:
Reads a CSV file (Grades_Short.csv) containing student scores. It calculates each student’s average, determines their final grade, assigns a letter grade, and saves the updated data in a new CSV file.

Grading scale:
Final grade > 90 -> A+
> 80 -> A
> 70 -> B
> 60 -> C
> 55 -> D
≤ 55 -> F

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- pandas (for the grade analyzer only)

To install pandas:
pip install pandas

To run a program:
python script_name.py
Where script_name.py can be:
- magic_8_ball.py
- fortune_cookie.py
- fizzbuzz.py
- analyze_grades.py

Files:
magic_8_ball.py
fortune_cookie.py
fizzbuzz.py
analyze_grades.py
Grades_Short.csv
